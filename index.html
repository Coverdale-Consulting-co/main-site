                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1vh;">After a few years in NYC Real Estate Development and Finance, I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the travel industry and have never looked back!</p>

Most recently, as Senior Director of Airline Relations for Concertiv Inc., more work has ensured that our travelers and industry partners have mutually beneficial programs in place to maximize savings and revenue opportunities. </p>
                        <p>Cherishing opportunities to work with many up-and-coming stars in the industry, Paul has previously held a seat on the Leadership Committee for GBTA Ladders and currently serves as President of the Black Men’s Travel Network, a group consisting of 100+ gentlemen across every category of business and leisure travel.</p>
